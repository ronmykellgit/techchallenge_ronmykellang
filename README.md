Just show your test explorer and run all tests.

Design Requirements
-------------------------
> Load the Bets and customers from the api endpoints. 

> Display a list of customers and their bets 

> Display the total stake a customer the customer had potentially won, irrelevant if a customer won or lost the bet.

> Clearly highlight customers that are winning or losing (total returnstake)

> Highlight bets with a return stake over 200 and a win 

-------------------------
Design 
-------------------------
A tabular form showing customer and their bets including if they are winning or not.
Some row highlights and specific column highlights are done to emphasize winning customers 
and its corresponding high return stake.

The table can be sorted. (I just added this feature though not requirements

Technology/Language used
